Documentation
-------------
Goblin War Fridge is designed to be a tailored repository of
nutritional knowledge, collecting and displaying only data relevant to
maintaining a healthy, rich, warrior lifestyle.

Are you an athelete, trying to perfect your body with the latest
understanding of protein synthesis and hourly fat breakdown?

#### Goblin War Fridge is not for you.

You, the athelete, would be better served by a trainer and professional
coaching.  You, the slim and fit, obvisouly don't need help managing
your eating habits.

You, the busy, you the life-liver, the over and underweight, the always
tired, and the inquisitive, might find this service helpful.

LOGIN NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
A warrior/user logs in, searches for ingredients, and assembles
meals out of those ingredients.  Meals currently assigned to a
warrior's account are in the warriorMeals table.  If a warrior
deselects a meal, it is kept in the meals table so other warriors
can view and learn from them.

All nutrition data comes from the USDA's FoodData Central database.

Special thanks to TutorialsPoint for their SQLite tutorials and the
team at SQLAlchemy for their ORM tutorial.
